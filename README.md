# MyReads Project

This is my assessment project for the React Fundamentals part of Udacity's React NanoDegree program. 

In this project, I have created a React application from scratch and utilized React components and React Router to manage the user interface.

The App is a virtual bookcase to store your books and track what you're reading. 
You can also move books from one shelf to another.

Using the provided Books API, you can search for books and add them to a bookshelf. 

Please note, that the API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your other searches don't come back with any results.

## To get started

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
